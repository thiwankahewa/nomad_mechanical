# Nomad Mechanical System

This project contains the design files for the **Nomad Mechanical System**, modeled using SolidWorks. The system includes various components and assemblies that can be used to simulate and manufacture the mechanical structure.

## Project Structure

The workspace contains the following files:

### Assembly Files
- **`nomad.SLDASM`**: The main assembly file for the Nomad Mechanical System.

### Part Files
- **`ball.SLDPRT`**: Represents the ball component.
- **`cage.SLDPRT`**: Represents the cage component.
- **`hub.SLDPRT`**: Represents the hub component.
- **`inner ring.SLDPRT`**: Represents the inner ring component.
- **`outer ring.SLDPRT`**: Represents the outer ring component.
- **`wheel.SLDPRT`**: Represents the wheel component.
- **`Part1.SLDPRT`**: Placeholder part file.
- **`Part2.SLDPRT`**: Placeholder part file.
- **`Part3.SLDPRT`**: Placeholder part file.
- **`Part4.SLDPRT`**: Placeholder part file.

## How to Use

1. Open the `nomad.SLDASM` file in SolidWorks to view the full assembly.
2. Modify individual part files (`.SLDPRT`) as needed to customize the design.
3. Use SolidWorks tools to simulate, analyze, or export the design for manufacturing.

## Notes

- Ensure you have SolidWorks installed to open and edit these files.
- Placeholder parts (`Part1.SLDPRT`, `Part2.SLDPRT`, etc.) can be replaced with actual components as the design evolves.
